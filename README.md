# Linear algebra

## Start here

- [The essence of linear algebra](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab) series. Animated introduction of most key concepts in linear algebra.

## Courses

- [MIT 18.06 Linear Algebra](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-06-linear-algebra-spring-2010/). A series of lectures by Dr. Gilbert Stang. Do not have the time? He greatly summarizes the series:
  - [A 2020 Vision of Linear Algebra](https://ocw.mit.edu/resources/res-18-010-a-2020-vision-of-linear-algebra-spring-2020/index.htm). Great overview in a little over an hour.
  - Lectures 1-8 from [MIT 18.065 Matrix Methods in Data Analysis, Signal Processing, and Machine Learning, Spring 2018](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUl4u3cNGP63oMNUHXqIUcrkS2PivhN3k).
- [Linear algebra 101](https://medium.com/sho-jp/tagged/linear-algebra). Heavily influenced by MIT 18.06, with nice diagrams and worked out examples.

## Intuitions of key concepts

- [A Geometrical Understanding of Matrices](http://gregorygundersen.com/blog/2018/10/24/matrices/).
- [Everything you did and didn't know about PCA](http://alexhwilliams.info/itsneuronalblog/2016/03/27/pca/).
